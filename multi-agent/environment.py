# The state representation is a list containings tuples of the difference in
# position between the predator and prey in the x and y directions. Each list
# element represents one predator. Distances are directional depending on their
# sign. As we're on a toroidal 11x11 grid, the distances are in the range from
# -5 to 5 (inclusive).
